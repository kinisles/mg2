        <video loop autoplay muted src="./media/cambridge.mp4"></video>
        <p>
This account is using minimal motion graphics to add on to his instagram story. The subtle animations (text fading in, sliding in) can be much more impactful than a still image.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="div2">
        <video loop autoplay muted src="./media/milo.mp4"></video >
        <p>This account is including motion into illustrations to make the post more captivating. We see the liquid getting bigger and bigger as if it was knocked into the screen and created a huge splash. We can also notice the animation in the text as it is continuously moving around.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="div3">
      <video loop autoplay muted src="./media/computek.mp4"></video >
